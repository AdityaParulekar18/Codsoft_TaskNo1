TASK 1: NUMBER GUESSING GAME in C++

This C++ program implements a straightforward and interactive Number Guessing Game. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user is prompted to guess the correct number. The program provides immediate feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, guiding the user to the correct answer. The game continues until the user successfully guesses the randomly generated number.

-->Features:
1. Random Number Generation: The program uses the C++ standard library functions to generate a random number between 1 and 100.
2. User Interaction: Users are prompted to input their guesses through the console.
3. Feedback Mechanism: Clear indications of whether the guess is too high or too low help users refine their guesses.
4. Looping Logic: The game continues to prompt the user until they correctly guess the randomly generated number.
5. Attempts Counter: The program keeps track of the number of attempts made by the user.
